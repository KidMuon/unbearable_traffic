# Welcome to the Unbearable Traffic Simulator

I am building this project as my first foray into simulation. The goal is to write the simulation itself in Go and visualize it running using Python. SQLite will be used to pass the data between the two. 

# Mapping Data
Mapping data is acquired from the OpenStreetMap Overpass API. Refer to the [Overpass API Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) for more details.
